## Notice
Gold GitHub Sponsors will gain access to a private `sponsor` repository, which includes the latest updates and exclusive features. The free, public version of this project will not be updated as frequently as the sponsor repository. If you are a Gold Sponsor, make sure to reference the `sponsor` repo's README instead of the public README, as the `sponsor` repo contains significant upgrades and changes not available in the public version. If you're interested in becoming a Gold Sponsor, you can [become one here.](https://github.com/sponsors/Prem-ium)

## Supported Brokerages
This project contains the means of automating buy/sell stock orders within:

- Ally Invest
- Charles Schwab
- Chase's J.P. Morgan Invest
- Fidelity
- Firstrade
- Merrill Edge Lynch
- Sofi Invest
- Vanguard
- Robinhood (GitHub Gold Sponsor, Early Access)
- WellsTrade (GitHub Gold Sponsor, Exclusive Access)

Note: Please note that although I no longer have an Ally Invest or Merrill Edge account, the existing scripts should still function as intended. However, I won't be able to provide updates or make changes specific to those platforms.

  <summary>Login Env Example</summary>
  <p>

  If you prefer, you can store your login information in a `.env` file to automatically open and log in to any brokerage. However, I strongly advise against this practice. Instead, I recommend using the login test to open the login URL and manually log in. Storing credentials in a `.side` file is  discouraged due to security reasons. Multiple account credentials are separated by the `:` character.

  Please note that the login test is a best-try approach. Some brokerages, like Chase, may block automated logins, but you can quickly fill out the user/password information manually if you choose to use this tool.
  </p>

  |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
  | `CHASE_LOGIN`     | Chase Account Credentials                     | String  | CHASE_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD" |

3. **Configure Environment Variables (`.env`):**
    - Create `.env` & Configure your (`.env`) file using [Environmental Variables](https://github.com/Prem-ium/Auto-StockTrader#environmental-variables) formats.

4. **Run the Python Script:**
  ```
    python main.py
  ```

  - Pass a Stock Ticker as an argument to update all `.side` files

  ```
    python main.py APPL
  ```

  - Seperate multiple with `,`
  ```bsh
    python main.py NVDA,TSLA,APPL
  ```

5. **Open Updated Side Files:**
   - Open updated `.side` project files in Selenium IDE.

6. **Execute Desired Automation within Selenium IDE:**

### Speed Considerations:
- Depending on your computer's speed, you may need to slow down test execution on faster machines (This can be done by assigning the `SET_SPEED` env, for Gold Sponsors. Otherwise, free-users may adjust the value manually using the slider in Selenium IDE).
- Selecting 'Reference' instead of 'Log' in Selenium IDE can slightly speed up execution.
- Enabling 'Best performance' battery mode on Laptop Battery settings can slightly speed up execution.
