`CHASE_AI` = A stringified JSON array containing your Chase Investment AI numbers
[found within the desktop stock order URL](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80719066/216079858-746af166-8387-41ad-9564-dd0c6285eb39.png), separated by commas.

`FIDELITY_AI` = A stringified JSON array containing your Fidelity Investment account numbers, separated by commas.

`ALLY_AI` = A stringified JSON array containing your Ally Investment account name + numbers, separated by commas.

- In [Ally Invest Settings Webpage](https://live.invest.ally.com/settings), you will need to change the default orders on the settings for all accounts to be a small penny stock for default stock ticker to miminize risk, Market, & Quantity: 1. Otherwise, running the automation script will buy 100 shares by default or whatever number you've previously entered into Ally default order settings.

Example:

```bash
CHASE_AI="['1234567890','0987654321']";
ALLY_AI="['Individual-A123456789','Individual-B098765432']";
FIRSTRADE_AI="['111111','222222']";
VANGUARD_AI="['54554326','54678936']";

### Installation

Clone the repository & install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prem-ium/Auto-StockTrader
cd Auto-StockTrader
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure [Enviornmental Variables](https://github.com/Prem-ium/Auto-StockTrader#enviornmental-variables) and run the script.

```
  python main.py
```

Passing an argument will quickly update the stock orders in all .side projects.

```
  python main.py APPL
```

## Selenium IDE

Automating Chase, Fidelity, Firstrade, Schwab, Vanguard, & Ally Invest, run `main.py` after configurating your `.env`.

Once you've generated your .side projects, login to your brokerage accounts on your browser and utilize the [Selenium IDE browser extension](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-ide) to open the `.side` projects generated & run your desired stock order automation(s).

For more assistance, refer to [archived README](https://github.com/Prem-ium/Auto-StockTrader/blob/main/src/X_Archive/README.MD)

# Archived Sofi Invest

Automating orders for Sofi Invest can be attempted through the now archived `sofi_main.py` Python script.
Sofi is very unpredictable and unstable, and has been archived with no plans for further development.
You can still attempt to use it, however the chances of every order going through are slim as Sofi Invest has weird order landing pages that contain different requirements & order layout for different stock tickers.

You can also attempt to use 'Sofi Invest.side` to loop through your accounts and _manually_ place orders. While not automated, it is a nice feature to have to help place orders on multiple accounts. Simpily replace the array with your account numbers, change 'Buy' or 'Sell' accordingly to get the correct order page.

## Donations

I've been working on this project for a few months now, and I'm really happy with how it's turned out. It's also been a helpful tool for users looking to run automated trading across multiple brokerage accounts at once. I'm currently working on adding new features to the script and working on other similar programs to generate passive income. I'm also working on making the script more user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience.


I'm accepting donations through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Prem-ium">GitHub Sponsors (No Fees!)</a> or <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/prem.ium">Buy-Me-Coffee</a>. Any amount you can donate will be greatly appreciated.
