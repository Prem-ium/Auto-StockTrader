## Supported Brokerages üè¶
This project contains the means of automating buy/sell stock orders within:

- Ally Invest
- Charles Schwab
- Chase's J.P. Morgan Invest
- Fidelity
- Firstrade
- Merrill Edge Lynch
- Sofi Invest
- Vanguard
- Robinhood (GitHub Gold Sponsor)

Note: Although I no longer have an Ally Invest or Merrill Edge account, the existing scripts should still work as intended. While I can‚Äôt provide direct updates for those platforms, I am able to assist with bug fixes or issues during a remote TeamViewer session for Gold sponsors.

## üöÄ Unlock Premium Features w/ Gold Sponsorship! üåü

Gold Sponsors get **exclusive access** to the private repository, filled with the latest updates, cool features, and handy tools. Here‚Äôs a glimpse of what you can expect as a Gold Sponsor: 

#### üåü **Optimized Python & Selenium Scripts**  
The private version of the automation script(s) have been **completely reworked** for maximum efficiency. Unlike the public version, which requires more configuration and manual setup (like for accounts with Chase and Fidelity), the Gold Sponsor version is designed to be **seamless**, **user-friendly**, and **fast**. 

#### ‚ö° **Up-to-Date & Faster Automation**  
You gain access to the latest updates for brokerage automation and project features, ensuring that any potential optimizations, errors, or bugs are promptly addressed in the private version. In contrast, the public version remains unchanged and is not updated as frequently.

#### üí∞ **Exclusive Tools**  
Gain access to the **Automated Cash Transfer/Withdrawal tool**, which lets you seamlessly consolidate funds from multiple accounts into a single account. This script also allows you to rename multiple accounts for easier management. Additionally, Gold Sponsors receive exclusive access to trading  automation for Robinhood and WellsTrade.

  <summary>Login Env Example</summary>
  <p>

  If you prefer, you can store your login information in a `.env` file to automatically open and log in to any brokerage. However, I strongly advise against this practice. Instead, I recommend using the login test to open the login URL and manually log in. Storing credentials in a `.side` file is  discouraged due to security reasons. Multiple account credentials are separated by the `:` character.

  Please note that the login test is a best-try approach. Some brokerages, like Chase, may block automated logins, but you can quickly fill out the user/password information manually if you choose to use this tool.
  </p>
  
  | Variable          | Description                                   | Type    | Example                        |
  |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
  | `CHASE_LOGIN`     | Chase Account Credentials                     | String  | CHASE_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD" |
  | `FIDELITY_LOGIN`  | Fidelity Account Credentials                  | String  | FIDELITY_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD"|
  | `FIRSTADE_LOGIN`  | Firstrade Account Credentials                 | String  | FIRSTADE_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD"|
  | `MERRILL_LOGIN`   | Merrill Account Credentials                    | String  | MERRILL_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD"|
  | `SCHWAB_LOGIN`    | Schwab Account Credentials                     | String  | SCHWAB_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD" |
  | `ALLY_LOGIN`      | Ally Account Credentials                       | String  | ALLY_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD"   |
  | `VANGUARD_LOGIN`  | Vanguard Account Credentials                   | String  | VANGUARD_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD"|

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

Follow these steps to set up and use Selenium IDE for automation:

1. **Download Selenium IDE:**
   - Install the Selenium IDE browser extension for your preferred browser from the add-on store. For the most reliable automation runs, it is recommend to use a Chromium browser. Avoid using Firefox if possible.
     - [Chrome Web Store Selenium IDE Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd)
     - [Edge Add-on Selenium IDE Page](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/selenium-ide/ajdpfmkffanmkhejnopjppegokpogffp)

2. **Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prem-ium/Auto-StockTrader
   cd Auto-StockTrader
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables (.env):**  
   Create a `.env` file and set up your environment variables following the formats outlined in the [Environmental Variables](https://github.com/Prem-ium/Auto-StockTrader#environmental-variables) section.

4. **Run the Python Script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   - Pass a stock ticker as an argument to update all `.side` files:
   ```bash
   python main.py AAPL
   ```

   - Separate multiple tickers with a comma:
   ```bash
   python main.py NVDA,TSLA,AAPL
   ```

5. **Open Updated .side Files:**
   - Open the updated `.side` project files in Selenium IDE.

6. **Execute Desired Automation within Selenium IDE:**
   - Log in to your brokerage account.
   - Begin running your desired automation tasks in either the buy or sell test tabs.

# Acknowledgments / Final Remarks üí¨
I express my sincere gratitude to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Prem-ium">my sponsors</a>, <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/prem.ium" target="_blank">donors</a>, &<a href="https://github.com/Prem-ium/Auto-StockTrader/graphs/contributors" target="_blank"> project contributor(s).</a>  Your support is invaluable, and it enables me to create exciting projects like this.

Thank you for backing my work. Each one of you plays a crucial role, and I am truly grateful for your contributions.
If you find this project interesting, please consider leaving a :star2:, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Prem-ium">donating, </a> or <a href="https://github.com/Prem-ium/Auto-StockTrader/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">contributing</a> if you found this project to be helpful!

## Other Projects

- **Tax Document Consolidator (Coming Soon):**: I‚Äôm developing a 1099 Tax Consolidation script that combines multiple tax PDFs from brokerages into a single CSV, detailing all relevant tax information (such as proceeds, costs, gains, interest earned, etc.). 
   - The script also offers data analysis and visualization for your 1099 tax returns. 
   - Useful for people with multiple accounts. Most accountants charge anywhere from $50-$100/per tax document; so the hope is it will help people save big. The program comes with a CSV/PDF viewer, which makes it easy to verify accuracy. 
   - Stay tuned for its release, which will be available for purchase soon.
- **[Referral-Link-Me](https://github.com/Prem-ium/Referral-Link-Me/blob/main/README.md):** Maximize your rewards with curated referral links for credit cards, brokerages, and more. 

## Speed Considerations:
- Adjust `SET_SPEED` env to control test execution pace on faster computers.
- Opt for 'Reference' over 'Log' in Selenium IDE for faster execution.
- Activate 'Best performance' mode in Laptop Battery settings to accelerate execution.
- Keep the browser's automation tab as the focused window for potential speed enhancements.
