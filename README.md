  <summary>Login Env Example</summary>
  <p>

  If you prefer, you can store your login information in a `.env` file to automatically open and log in to any brokerage. However, I strongly advise against this practice. Instead, I recommend using the login test to open the login URL and manually log in. Storing credentials in a `.side` file is  discouraged due to security reasons. Multiple account credentials are separated by the `:` character.

  Please note that the login test is a best-try approach. Some brokerages, like Chase, may block automated logins, but you can quickly fill out the user/password information manually if you choose to use this tool.
  </p>
  
  | Variable          | Description                                   | Type    | Example                        |
  |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
  | `CHASE_LOGIN`     | Chase Account Credentials                     | String  | CHASE_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD" |
  | `FIDELITY_LOGIN`  | Fidelity Account Credentials                  | String  | FIDELITY_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD"|
  | `FIRSTADE_LOGIN`  | Firstrade Account Credentials                 | String  | FIRSTADE_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD"|
  | `MERRILL_LOGIN`   | Merrill Account Credentials                    | String  | MERRILL_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD"|
  | `SCHWAB_LOGIN`    | Schwab Account Credentials                     | String  | SCHWAB_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD" |
  | `ALLY_LOGIN`      | Ally Account Credentials                       | String  | ALLY_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD"   |
  | `VANGUARD_LOGIN`  | Vanguard Account Credentials                   | String  | VANGUARD_LOGIN="USERNAME:PASSWORD"|
